Rock, Paper, Scissors:

Rock crushes Scissors: The rock wins against scissors because a rock can crush scissors.

Scissors cuts Paper: Scissors win against paper because scissors can cut through paper.

Paper covers Rock: Paper wins against rock because paper can cover and wrap around a rock.

The game is often used as a decision-making tool between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The winner is determined by the rules above, with rock beating scissors, scissors beating paper, and paper beating rock. If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.
